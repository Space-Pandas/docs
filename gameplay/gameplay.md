## Stats

Each Space Panda has 6 stats, Health, Strength, Attack, Luck, Speed, Race. Here's what they do:

* Health - The amount of damage your space panda can take before being knocked out.
* Strength - The strength mainly effects the adventure and [SPT](https://docs.pandas.land/economic/spt-token) mining.
* Attack - The damage your space panda can make during a battle.
* Luck - Luck increases critical strike chance.
* Speed - The speed mainly effects the battle and mining.
* Race - Space pandas were born with a race, different race can add different abilities to them.

## Body Parts

Each Space Panda has 6 body parts: eye, mouth, nose, limbs, hair, glow. These body parts can determine the ability value of a space panda. The minimum value of ability is 20, and the maximum is 100.

The ability is very important, it can add extra ratio to Health/Strength/Attach/Luck. The below table shows how the ability works \(suppose the space pandas are only different with ability score\):

| Space Pandas | Health | Strength | Attach | Luck |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Ability of 0 | 20 | 30 | 40 | 20 |
| Ability of 20 | 24 | 36 | 48 | 24 |
| Ability of 100 | 40 | 60 | 80 | 40 |

Ability was determined when the space panda was born.
