# Cross-Chain

## What is Cross-Chain

[Space Panda NFT chain](https://github.com/Space-Pandas/space-panda-nft-chain) \(short as SNFT chain\) is based on [Substrate](https://substrate.dev/). It is designed as a NFT bridge across all the EVM chains as well as Polkadot chains.

All the famous NFTs, such as [Hashmasks](https://www.thehashmasks.com/), [CryptoPunks](https://www.larvalabs.com/cryptopunks),  can be cross-chain transfer to the NFT chain. Users can trade them freely and pay lower gas fee for them.

The SNFT chain contains a lot of game and Defi characteristics. For example, the SNFT chain natively has the  'stake to gain' feature, and users can stake their NFTs to gain SPT.

## Cross-Chain Governance

In order to support different NFTs to cross-chain transfer to SNFT chain, we need a NFT whitelist assets. Only the NFTs on the whitelist can be allowed to do the cross-chain. The following parameters should be governed on SNFT chain:

* The whitelist blockchains. For example Ethereum, BSC, etc.
* The whitelist assets on blockchains. For example the Hashmasks on Ethereum.
