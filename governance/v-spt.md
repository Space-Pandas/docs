# vSPT

## What are vSPT

vSPT \(Voting SPT\) is a governance token inspired by [Curve](https://curve.fi/). Users can stake their SPT to gain vSPT, and this is the only way to get it.

The number of vSPT you will receive depends on how long you lock your SPT for. The minimum locking time is one week and the maximum locking time is four years.

The rules can be explained as follows:

* 1 SPT locked for 4 years = 1 vSPT
* 1 SPT locked for 3 years = 0.75 vSPT
* 1 SPT locked for 2 years = 0.50 vSPT
* 1 SPT locked for 1 year = 0.25 vSPT
